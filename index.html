                <p>My career in IT started on a less traditional path than most. I graduated with a degree in
                    History followed by a Master’s degree in Education. The job market for History teachers was
                    pretty thin at the time but the budding “Dot-Com Boom” and looming “Y2K Disaster” presented a
                    new opportunity. Liberty Mutual was willing to take a chance with people from non-technical
                    majors to be trained internally and so I was able to get my foot in the door.</p>
                <p>I started my career enhancing a PL1 mainframe system in anticipation of Y2K. By the time the new
                    millenium arrived, and both world and company were still standing, I had shown some aptitude for
                    the profession. I was assigned to a group to design and develop a new Policy Admin system using
                    “cutting edge” technology such as C++ and Aion. Over the years I grew into a technical
                    leadership role and ultimately owner of the domain. Shortly after promotion to Technologist I
                    was asked to refactor this system, this time into web services utilizing Java, BPM and ODM.
                    Years later it is time for another refactor and I am currently in the process of working through
                    designs to break down the monolith, establish distributed microservices, and move to the cloud.
                </p>
                <p>Through it all my family has built a very happy life in coastal New Hampshire. My wife and I have
                    three kids, all now (mostly) grown. We now enjoy a quiet house shared with a feisty Jack Russell
                    , a slightly touched Rat Terrier, and a chinchlla named "Gunther". </p>
